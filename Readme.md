# Schleifchen ðŸŽ€

A set of decorators and associated functions to make building vanilla web
components a little less painful. Where you would previously have had to write
the following boilerplate monstrosity:

```javascript
// The following code is *required* to create a new element with a single string
// attribute that behaves like other string attributes on built-in elements (eg.
// the id attribute)

class GreeterElement extends HTMLElement {
  // Internal "name" state, initialized from the element's HTML attributes, with
  // a default value in case the attribute is not set
  #name = this.getAttribute("name") || "";

  // DOM getter, required to make JS operations like `console.log(el.name)` work
  get name() {
    return this.#name;
  }

  // DOM setter with type checking and/or conversion and attribute updates,
  // required to make JS operations like `el.name = "Alice"` work
  set name(value) {
    value = String(value);
    this.#name = value;
    this.setAttribute("name", value);
  }

  // Attribute change handling, required to make JS operations like
  // `el.setAttribute("name", "Bob")` work
  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
    if (name === "name" && newValue !== this.#name) {
      this.#name = newValue;
    }
  }

  // Required for attribute change monitoring to work
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ["name"];
  }
}

// Finally register the element, with an extra check to make sure that the
// tag name has not already been registered
if (!window.customElements.has("greeter-element")) {
  window.customElements.define("greeter-element", GreeterElement);
}
```

... you can now get away with just this:

```javascript
import { define, attr, string } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

// Register the element
@define("greeter-element")
class GreeterElement extends HTMLElement {
  // Define an accessor with an attribute decorator to get attributes handling
  // as well as getter and setter creation for (in this case) arbitrary strings
  @attr(string()) accessor name = "Anonymous";
}
```

## Scope

Schleifchen is decidedly not a framework and its scope is strictly limited to
only the most tedious bits of building standards-compliant web components. Its
sole goal is is to make attribute and property handling less of a chore.
Schleifchen's decorators are easy to add and also easy to remove and replace.

Schleifchen does not concern itself with rendering Shadow DOM, managing
cross-element communication, or state management. If you need any of these
features, ou can of course combine Schleifchen with other libraries such as
[uhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml) to deal with eg. Shadow DOM:

```javascript
import { render, html } from "uhtml";
import { define, prop, reactive, int } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen";

@define("counter-element")
export class CounterElement extends HTMLElement {
  @prop(int()) accessor value = 0;

  @reactive() #render() {
    render(
      this.shadowRoot ?? this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" }),
      html`
        Current value: ${this.value}
        <button .click={() => ++this.value}>Add 1</button>
      `
    );
  }
}
```

This component uses an event handler to update the decorated accessor `value`,
which in turn causes the `@reactive` method `#render()` to update the UI
accordingly. Other approaches, such as full-blown frameworks make similar
functionality even more accessible, but those are usually full-blown frameworks
with all sorts of attached baggage and mist of them have no capability to
properly express dom properties and attributes exactly like the build-in
elements do. If you are about any of the above, Schleifchen will save you quite
a few keystrokes.

## Notable deviations from standard behavior

1. Schleifchen implements attribute change handling via MutationObservers and
   not via the usual `attributeChangedCallback()`.

## Decorators

### `@define(tagName)`

Class decorator to register a class as a custom element:

```javascript
import { define } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {}
```

### `@prop(transformer)`

The accessor decorator `@prop()` defines a property on the custom element class.
Such a property is more or less a regular accessor with two additional features:

- it uses [transformers]() for type checking and validation and updates to properties defined with `@prop()`
- changes cause `@reactive()` methods to run

Example:

```javascript
import { define, prop, number } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  // Applies the number transformer to ensure that new values are always numbers
  @prop(number()) accessor foo = 23;

  // Automatically runs when "foo" (or any accessor decorated with @prop() or
  // @attr()) changes
  @reactive log() {
    console.log(`Foo changed to ${this.foo}`);
  }
}

let testEl = document.createElement("test-element");
console.log(testEl.foo); // logs 23
testEl.foo = 42; // logs "Foo changed to 42"
console.log(testEl.foo); // logs 42
testEl.foo = "asdf"; // throw exception (thanks to the number transformer)
```

Accessors defined with `@prop()` works as a JavaScript-only API. Values can only
be accessed through the accessors, invalid values are rejected with exceptions.
`@prop()` can be used on private accessors.

### `@attr(transformer, options?)`

The accessor decorator `@attr()` defines a property and matching attribute on
the custom element class. This results in something very similar to properties
defined with `@prop()`, but with the following additional features:

- Its value can be initialized from an attribute, if the attribute is present
- Changes to value or attribute update the value or attribute to match (depending on the options and the transformer)

```javascript
import { define, attr, number } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  // Applies the number transformer to ensure that attribute values get parsed
  // into numbers and that new non-number values get rejected
  @attr(number()) accessor foo = 23;

  // Automatically runs when "foo" (or any accessor decorated with @prop() or
  // @attr()) changes
  @reactive log() {
    console.log(`Foo changed to ${this.foo}`);
  }
}

document.body.innerHTML = `<test-element foo="42"></test-element>`;
let testEl = document.body.children[0];
console.log(testEl.foo); // logs 42 (initialized from the attribute)
testEl.foo = 1337; // logs "Foo changed to 1337"
console.log(testEl.foo); // logs 1337
console.log(testEl.getAttribute("foo")); // logs "1337"
testEl.foo = "asdf"; // throw exception (thanks to the number transformer)
```

Accessors defined with `@attr()` works like all other supported attributes on
build-in elements. Attribute values (which are always strings) get parsed by the
transformer, which also deals with invalid values in a graceful way (ie without
throwing exceptions). Values can also be accessed through the accessors, where
invalid values *are* rejected with exceptions. `@attr()` can *not* be used on
private accessors or symbols.

#### Options for `@attr()`

- **`as` (string, optional)**: Sets an attribute name different from the accessor's name, similar to how the `class` attribute works for the `className` property on build-in elements. If `as` is not set, the attribute's will be equal to the accessor's name.
- **`reflective` (boolean, optional)**: If false, prevents the attribute from updating when the accessor's value changes, similar to how `value` works on `input` elements. Defaults to true.

### `@reactive(options?)`

Method decorator that causes class methods to re-run when any accessor decorated
with `@prop()` or `@attr()` changes. Method runs are debounced to that multiple
changes to accessor values only cause a single method call:

```javascript
import { define, prop, number } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @prop(number()) accessor foo = 0;
  @prop(number()) accessor bar = 0;

  @reactive log() {
    console.log(`foo is now ${this.foo}, bar is now ${this.bar}`);
  }
}

let testEl = document.createElement("test-element");
testEl.foo = 1;
testEl.bar = 2;
testEl.foo = 3;

// only logs "foo is now 3, bar is now 2" on the next microtask
```

#### Options for `@reactive()`

- **`initial` (boolean, optional)**: Whether or not to run the function when the element initializes, before any actual changes to any decorated accessor. Defaults to `true`
- **`predicate` ((this: T) => boolean, optional)**: The predicate function, if provided, gets called each time a reactive method is scheduled to run. If the predicate function returns false, the function does not run. The predicate function is called with `this` set to the element instance. By default all reactive methods are called for each change.

## Transformers

Transformers define how the accessor decorators `@attr()` and `@prop()`
implement attribute and property handling. Their type signature is as follows:

```typescript
export type Transformer<T extends HTMLElement, V> = {
  // parse() turns attribute values (usually string | null) into property
  // values. Must *never* throw exceptions, but always deal with its input in a
  // graceful way, just like the attribute handling in built-in elements works.
  parse: (this: T, value: unknown) => V;
  // Validates setter inputs, which may be of absolutely any type. May throw for
  // invalid values, just like setters on built-in elements may.
  validate: (this: T, value: unknown) => V;
  // Turns property values into attributes values (strings), thereby controlling
  // the attribute representation of an accessor together with
  // updateAttrPredicate(). Must never throw.
  stringify: (this: T, value?: V | null) => string;
  // Decides if, based on a new value, an attribute gets updated to match the
  // new value (true/false) or removed (null). Defaults to a function that
  // always returns true.
  updateAttrPredicate?: (this: T, value: V) => boolean | null;
  // Runs before accessor initialization and can be used to perform side effects
  // or to grab the accessors initial value as defined in the class.
  beforeInitCallback?: (
    this: T,
    value: V,
    defaultValue: V,
    context: ClassAccessorDecoratorContext<T, V>
  ) => void;
  // Runs before an accessor's setter sets a new value and can be used to
  // perform side effects
  beforeSetCallback?: (
    this: T,
    value: V,
    context: ClassAccessorDecoratorContext<T, V>
  ) => void;
};
```

If you want to extend Schleifchen, you should simply clone one of the built-in
transformers and modify it to your liking!

### Transformer `string()`

Implements a string attribute or property. Loosely modeled after built-in string
attributes such as `id` and `lang`.

```javascript
import { define, attr, string } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @attr(string()) accessor foo = "default value";
}
```

In this case, the property `foo` always represents a string. Any non-string
value gets converted to strings. When used with `@attr()`, if the attribute gets
removed, the value that was used to initialize the accessor (in this case
`"default value"`) is returned. The same happens when the property is set to
`undefined`. If the accessor was not initialized with a value, the empty string
is used.

### Transformer `href()`

Implements a string attribute or property that works like `href` on `a` in that
it automatically turns relative URLs into absolute URLs.

```javascript
import { define, attr, href } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @attr(href()) accessor foo = "";
}

let testEl = new Test();

// Assuming that the page is served from localhost:
console.log(testEl.foo); // > "http://localhost"
testEl.foo = "asdf"
console.log(testEl.foo); // > "http://localhost/asdf"
testEl.foo = "https://example.com/foo/bar/"
console.log(testEl.foo); // > "https://example.com/foo/bar/"
```

### Transformer `number(options?)`

Implements a number attribute or property.

```javascript
import { define, attr, number } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  // With default options (see below)
  @attr(number()) accessor foo = 0;

 // With all options set
  @attr(number({ min: 0, max: 10 })) accessor bar = 0;
}
```

Non-numbers get converted to numbers, but never to `NaN` - the property setter
throws an exception when its input converts to `NaN`. When used with `@attr()`,
if the attribute gets removed or set to some non-numeric value, the value that
was used to initialize the accessor (in this case `0`) is returned. The same
happens when the property is set to `undefined`.

#### Options for `number()`

- **`min` (number, optional)**: Smallest possible value. Defaults to `-Infinity`. Attribute values less than `min` get clamped, property values get validated and (if too small) rejected with an exception.
- **`max` (number, optional)**: Largest possible value. Defaults to `Infinity`. Attribute values greater than `max` get clamped, property values get validated and (if too large) rejected with an exception.

### Transformer `int(options?)`

Implements a bigint attribute or property. Attribute values are expressed as
plain numeric strings without the tailing `n` used in JavaScript bigints.

```javascript
import { define, attr, int } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  // With default options (see below)
  @attr(int()) accessor foo = 0n;

 // With all options set
  @attr(int({ min: 0n, max: 10n })) accessor bar = 0n;
}
```

The property setter throws an exception when its input cannot be converted to
bigint. When used with `@attr()`, if the attribute gets removed or set to some
non-numeric value, the value that was used to initialize the accessor (in the
above examples `0n`) is returned. The same happens when the property is set to
`undefined`.

#### Options for `int()`

- **`min` (bigint, optional)**: Smallest possible value. Defaults to the maximum possible bigint value. Attribute values less than `min` get clamped, property values get validated and (if too small) rejected with an exception.
- **`max` (bigint, optional)**: Largest possible value. Defaults to the minimum possible bigint value. Attribute values greater than `max` get clamped, property values get validated and (if too large) rejected with an exception.

### Transformer `boolean()`

Implements a boolean attribute or property. Modeled after built-in boolean
attributes such as `disabled`. Changes to the property values toggle the
attribute and do not just change that attribute value.

```javascript
import { define, attr, boolean } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen"

class DemoElement extends HTMLElement {
  @attr(boolean()) accessor foo = false;
}
```

In this case, the property `foo` always represents a boolean. Any non-boolean
value gets coerced to booleans. If the attribute `foo` gets set to any value
(including the empty string), `foo` returns `true` - only a missing attribute
counts as `false`.

### Transformer `literal(options)`

Implements an attribute or property with a finite number of valid values. Should
really be called "enum", but that's a reserved word in JavaScript. It works by
declaring the valid list of values and a matching transformer. If, for example,
the list of valid values consists of strings, then the `string()` transformer is
the right transformer to use:

```javascript
import { define, attr, literal, string } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen";

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @attr(literal({ values: ["A", "B"], transformer: string() })) accessor foo = "A";
}
```

In this case, the attribute can be set to any value (as is usual in HTML), but
if the attribute gets set to a value other than `A` or `B`, the properties's
value will remain unchanged. Any attempt at setting the property to values other
than `A` or `B` will result in an exception.

The default value is either the value the accessor was initialized with or the
first element in `values`.

#### Options for `literal()`

- **`values` (array)**: List of valid values. Must contain at least one element.
- **`transformer` (Transformer)**: Transformer to use, eg. `string()` for a list of strings, `number()` for numbers etc.

### Transformer `record()`

Implements a plain object property that gets reflected as a JSON attribute when
used with `@attr()`. Such attributes do not exist in standard HTML, but may be
useful nevertheless:

```javascript
import { define, attr, record } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen";

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @attr(record()) accessor foo = { user: "", email: "" };
}
```

Attribute values are parsed with `JSON.parse()`. Invalid JSON is represented
with the object used to initialize the accessor, or the empty object if the
accessor has no initial value. Using the setter with non-objects throws
TypeErrors. Note that this transformer is really just a wrapper around
`JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` without any object validation.

### Transformer `eventHandler()`

Implements an old-school inline event handler property/attribute in the style of
`onclick="console.log(42)"`. To work properly, this should only be used in
conjunction with `@attr()` (with reflectivity enabled) and on an accessor that
starts with `on`:

```javascript
import { define, attr, eventHandler } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen";

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @attr(eventHandler()) accessor onfoo: ((evt: Event) => void) | null = null;
}
```

This can then be used in HTML:

```html
<test-element onfoo="console.log('Foo event:', event)"></test-element>
<script>
  document.querySelector("test-element").dispatchEvent(new Event("foo"));
  // Logs "'Foo event:', Event{type: "foo"}"
</script>
```

Or in JavaScript:

```javascript
const testEl = document.createElement("test-element");
testEl.onfoo = (event) => console.log("Foo event:", event);
testEl.dispatchEvent(new Event("foo"));
// Logs "'Foo event:', Event{type: "foo"}"
```

Regular "proper" `addEventListener()` is obviously also always available.

It should be noted that for build-in events that bubble, inline event handlers
can be added to any element in order to facilitate event delegation. These event
handlers are considered global event handlers, and all custom inline event
handlers are obviously not global - they can only be used on the components that
explicitly implement them.

## Cookbook

### Read-only property

You can create a writable private accessor with `@prop()` and manually expose a
public getter. This keeps reactive functions working, but only allows readonly
access from outside the component:

```javascript
import { define, attr, string } from "@sirpepe/schleifchen";

@define("test-element")
class Test extends HTMLElement {
  @prop(string()) accessor #foo = "Starting value";

  // Provides readonly access to #foo
  get foo() {
    return this.#foo;
  }

  change() {
    this.#foo++;
  }

  // Reacts to changes to #foo
  @reactive log() {
    console.log(this.#foo);
  }
}
```
